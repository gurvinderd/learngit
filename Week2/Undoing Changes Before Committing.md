- Undoing changes can be done in three states, before staging, after staging, after commit.
- `git checkout fileName`: Used for unstaged files which have been changed. It reverts changes to modified files before they are staged.
- `git reset HEAD fileNameToBeUnstaged` : Used to reset files which are already staged. It restores the file to the current checkout Version.
- `git commit --amend` : Overwrite the previous local commit. Do not use to Overwrite commits already pushed.
- `git commit -a --amend` : Stage and amend last commit
- `git revert HEAD` : Rollback last commit. Verify using `git log -p -2`
- `git revert commitID` :  Rollback changes of a specific commit
